"""A module for defining force fields that can be applied to a universe

Each force field consists of a combination of interaction functions, and also
the values of the parameters within these functions.  In this instance water
models (such as SPCE and TIP3P) are also defined as force fields, even though
the parameter sets are restricted to describing water.
