"""System tests for LAMMPS MD simulations

Compares the thermodynamic and simulation properties calculated from the MDMC
run using LAMMPS with the same properties calculated from an equivalent LAMMPS
setup run externally. This occurs for NVE, NVT and NPT ensembles.  The
calculations of the properties in both cases are performed by LAMMPS, the only
difference is whether the LAMMPS simulation was run through MDMC.
